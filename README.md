## Project Description 
This is an API for a social network framework featuring "Users", who can post "Thoughts". Other users can post "Reactions" to those thoughts.

## Installation Instructions 
after cloning the repo, use `npm run build` to build the .ts code and `npm run start` to run the server.

## Usage 
I will describe usage in the context of integrating a front-end on top of this back-end. In this case, refer to the controllers folder for API definitions and refer to the routes folder to understand how to access the routes. 

## Contribution Guidelines 
No special guidelines

## Testing Instructions 
I will describe testing in the context of extending the backend. I recommend using software like Insomnia to test routes.
